### Open-source changelog creation tool

Build in Node - meant to be kept as lightweight as possible.

Mostly used as a listener to build a changelog for my [personal website](https://github.com/aleemrehman/aleem-next-blog).

NodeJS server-side code is hit by a GitHub hook, this data is then saved into a notion database to be served further.

I've hosted on PaaS platform Heroku - I would suggest deploying with them too.

### Run

- Fork or clone the repo locally.
- Duplicate this Notion page or copy manually.
- Create a notion integration and associate it with the correct DB root page.
- Add a .env file which follows the same layout as .example.env.
